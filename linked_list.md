## 🧠 Introduction

A **Linked List** is a dynamic data structure consisting of **nodes**, where each node holds:

- A **data** field
- A **pointer (link)** to the next node (and possibly the previous one in DLLs)

Understanding linked lists is crucial for mastering:

- **Dynamic memory & pointer manipulation**
- **Recursion-based algorithms**
- **In-place list modification**
- **Loop detection, sorting, and rearrangement**
