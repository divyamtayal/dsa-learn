## 🧠 Best Practices

- Use **C++ STL** effectively (`vector`, `map`, `stack`, `queue`, `priority_queue`).
- Focus on **approach clarity**, not just syntax.
- Keep comments and dry runs inside your `.cpp` solutions.
- Re-implement problems after 3–4 days to reinforce retention.
- For every algorithm, know its **time/space complexity and intuition**.

## 🌟 Vision

> “DSA mastery isn’t about memorizing 1000 problems.  
> It’s about learning 100 problems that teach 1000 patterns.”

This repo is your **living syllabus** for mastering DSA from scratch —  
systematic, pattern-driven, and interview-focused.

## 💬 Author Note

> Built for learners who want **clarity over chaos** — no scattered notes, no endless lists.  
> Just structured learning, solid patterns, and pure problem-solving.
