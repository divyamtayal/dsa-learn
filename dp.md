## üß† Introduction

Dynamic Programming (DP) is the **art of solving overlapping subproblems efficiently** using recursion, memoization, and tabulation.  
It‚Äôs the bridge between brute-force recursion and optimal substructure solutions.

This section covers:

- 1D, 2D, and 3D DPs
- Subsequence-based DPs
- Grid and String DPs
- Partition DPs and LIS-based DPs
- Space optimization techniques (1D ‚Üí 2D ‚Üí O(1))

By mastering these, you‚Äôll move from solving **basic recurrence problems** to **top-tier interview-level optimizations**.
