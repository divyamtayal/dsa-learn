## 🧠 Introduction

Bit Manipulation is one of the most powerful low-level techniques used in:

- Optimizing space and arithmetic operations  
- Subset and mask generation  
- Power of two / parity checks  
- Fast mathematical computations  
- Cryptography and number theory  

Understanding bit operations helps you think **at the binary level** — essential for high-performance code and competitive programming.

## 💡 Basic Bit Operations

| # | Problem | Concept | Status |
|---|----------|----------|--------|
| 1 | **Introduction to Bit Manipulation (Theory)** | Learn bitwise AND, OR, XOR, NOT, shift operators | ☐ |
| 2 | **Check if i-th Bit is Set** | `(n >> i) & 1` | ☐ |
| 3 | **Check if a Number is Odd or Even** | `n & 1` | ☐ |
| 4 | **Check if a Number is Power of 2** | `n & (n - 1)` trick | ☐ |
| 5 | **Count Number of Set Bits** | Brian Kernighan’s Algorithm | ☐ |
| 6 | **Set/Unset the Rightmost Unset Bit** | Use `n | (n + 1)` and related ops | ☐ |
| 7 | **Swap Two Numbers (Without Temp)** | XOR swap trick | ☐ |

🧩 *Goal:* Build intuition on how numbers behave at the bit level and get comfortable with shifts and masks.

## 🧮 Bit Tricks & Logic Problems

| # | Problem | Concept | Status |
|---|----------|----------|--------|
| 1 | **Divide Two Integers Without `/`, `*`, `%`** | Use bit shifts to simulate division | ☐ |
| 2 | **Count Bits to Flip to Convert A → B** | XOR both numbers and count bits | ☐ |
| 3 | **Find Number Appearing Odd Times** | XOR of all numbers | ☐ |
| 4 | **Power Set (All Subsets)** | Generate subsets using bitmask of length *n* | ☐ |
| 5 | **Find XOR from L to R** | Compute XOR pattern using `xorUpto(n)` | ☐ |
| 6 | **Find Two Numbers Appearing Odd Times** | XOR grouping technique | ☐ |

🧠 *Pattern:* XOR is your best friend — it cancels duplicates and isolates differences elegantly.

## 🔱 Prime & Number Theory Extensions

| # | Problem | Concept | Status |
|---|----------|----------|--------|
| 1 | **Print Prime Factors of a Number** | Trial division up to √n | ☐ |
| 2 | **All Divisors of a Number** | Iterate till √n and collect pairs | ☐ |
| 3 | **Sieve of Eratosthenes** | Mark multiples efficiently using bits/array | ☐ |
| 4 | **Prime Factorization using Sieve** | Precompute smallest prime factor (SPF) | ☐ |

🧠 *Pattern:* Combine number theory with bit concepts — the sieve uses boolean flags that parallel bit masking principles.

## ⚡ Power and Exponentiation

| # | Problem | Concept | Status |
|---|----------|----------|--------|
| 1 | **Power(n, x)** | Binary exponentiation (fast power) using bit logic | ☐ |

🧩 *Goal:* Understand how bits in the exponent drive the multiply-skip behavior in fast exponentiation.

## 🧠 Concepts to Remember

| Concept | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Bit Masking** | Represent subset, toggle, or selection via bits |
| **Shift Operations** | `<<` doubles, `>>` halves (for positive numbers) |
| **Set/Unset/Toggle** | Set: `n \| (1<<i)`, Unset: `n & ~(1<<i)`, Toggle: `n ^ (1<<i)` |
| **Brian Kernighan’s Algorithm** | Efficiently counts set bits (`n = n & (n-1)`) |
| **Power of Two** | A number has only one set bit → `(n & (n-1)) == 0` |
| **XOR Properties** | `a ^ a = 0`, `a ^ 0 = a`, associative & commutative |
| **Subset Enumeration** | Iterate `mask` from `0` to `(1<<n)-1` for all combinations |
| **Fast Exponentiation** | If exponent’s bit is 1 → multiply; always square base |

## 📆 Study Plan (3 Weeks)

| Week | Focus | Key Topics |
|------|--------|------------|
| **Week 1** | Bit Fundamentals | Bit operations, odd/even, power of 2, counting bits |
| **Week 2** | XOR & Mask Problems | Odd times numbers, power set, L to R XOR |
| **Week 3** | Number Theory | Prime factorization, sieve, binary exponentiation |

🧩 *Tip:* Re-implement each problem using **bitwise logic only** — avoid arithmetic where possible to train bit intuition.
