## üß† Introduction

Trees model hierarchical data and are central to many algorithms. Start with representations and traversals, then move to problem patterns: recursion, divide-and-conquer, BFS levels, two-pointer analogues on paths, and transform problems (serialize/flatten). BSTs add ordering guarantees enabling search/selection optimizations.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Concepts to Remember

- **Recursive templates**: many tree problems use a postorder pattern (`left`, `right`, `process`) returning heterogeneous info (height, sum, valid flag).
- **Parent pointer trick**: convert tree problems to graph-BFS when you need "distance from node" or burn-time.
- **Indexing for width/vertical**: use `(index)` per node or horizontal distance `hd`. Beware overflow; normalize indices by subtracting min index per level if needed.
- **Morris Traversal**: learn threaded links (temporary) to achieve O(1) extra space.
- **BST invariants**: use range constraints for validation and for efficient LCA/ceil/floor.
- **Construct-from-traversals**: preorder/postorder + inorder uniquely identify binary trees; preorder+postorder alone do not (unless additional constraints).
- **Inorder-based solutions**: many selection and order problems reduce to inorder traversal (sorted order of BST).

## üõ† How to Use This File

1. For each problem: write a clear problem statement at the top of a `.cpp` or `.java` file.
2. Implement the **recursive** solution first, then iterative and optimized versions.
3. Add a short **explanation** comment block: approach, complexity, edge-cases.
4. Unit-test with small trees and edge cases (empty tree, single-node, skewed tree).
5. Check off progress in the tracker above.

## üí¨ Author Note

Trees are where recursion becomes intuition. Start by mastering traversal patterns and then build up to view/path problems and construction tasks. BSTs are a natural follow-up ‚Äî they teach how ordering empowers logarithmic operations.
