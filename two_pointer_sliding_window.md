## üß† Introduction

The **Two Pointer** and **Sliding Window** techniques are powerful tools to convert brute-force `O(n¬≤)` solutions  
into clean `O(n)` or `O(n log n)` algorithms.

They are widely used in:

- Longest / shortest substring problems
- Counting subarrays / substrings
- Sum, distinct count, or character frequency problems
- Optimizing dynamic range queries

## üß© Concepts to Remember

| Concept                       | Description                                                                              |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Two Pointers**              | Two indices (`left`, `right`) moving in a coordinated way to track valid ranges or pairs |
| **Sliding Window**            | Dynamic window [left..right] that expands/contracts based on conditions                  |
| **Fixed vs Variable Window**  | Fixed keeps constant length; Variable adjusts both sides dynamically                     |
| **At Most K / Exactly K**     | Use difference of counts: `exactlyK = atMost(K) ‚àí atMost(K‚àí1)`                           |
| **Prefix Sum + Two Pointers** | Convert sum constraints into pointer motion                                              |
| **Character Frequency Map**   | Essential for substring counting problems                                                |
